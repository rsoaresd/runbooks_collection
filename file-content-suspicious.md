# file-content-suspicious

## Overview

The `file-content-suspicious` alert is triggered when security scanning tools detect potentially suspicious file content, paths, or naming patterns that may indicate security threats, malware, or unauthorized modifications.

## AI Analysis Instructions

> **IMPORTANT FOR AI AGENTS:** This runbook is for **analysis and recommendation only**. You are in read-only investigation mode. DO NOT attempt to modify, delete, quarantine, or remediate any files. Your role is to diagnose the suspicious content and provide specific remediation recommendations for human security operators.

## Investigation Workflow

Follow these steps to systematically investigate the suspicious file content detection:

### Phase 1: Alert Context Analysis

#### Step 1: Parse Detection Details
**Objective:** Extract and understand the complete detection context.

**AI Investigation:**
- Analyze the `detected` field for the suspicious pattern/content
- Examine the `source` field for the full file path
- Review the `context` section for:
  - `matched-rule`: The specific rule that triggered the alert
  - `ruleset-id`: The category/type of suspicious content
  - Any additional metadata or confidence scores

**What to analyze:**
- File path components and directory structure
- File extension and naming patterns

### Phase 2: File System Investigation

#### Step 2: Analyze File Location Context
**Objective:** Understand the file's location and legitimacy within the system.

**AI Investigation:**
- Examine the full file path for:
  - System vs. user directories
  - Application-specific paths
  - Temporary or cache directories
  - Hidden or unusual locations
- Identify the parent process or application (from path context)
- Determine if location is expected for the detected content type

**Example Analysis:**
Source: /proc/429630/root/usr/lib/python3.6/site-packages/pgadmin4-web/pgadmin/static/scss/resources/dark
- Process ID: 429630
- Application: pgAdmin4 web interface
- Content type: SCSS resources (styling)
- Detected pattern: "dark" (likely dark theme files)

#### Step 3: Assess File Legitimacy
**Objective:** Determine if the detected content is legitimate or truly suspicious.

**AI Investigation:**
- Research the application context (e.g., pgAdmin4 in example)
- Analyze if detected pattern makes sense for the application
- Access the file and check for any suspicious behaviour
- Check for:
  - Known false positive patterns
  - Legitimate use cases for the detected content
  - Application documentation or common file structures

### Phase 3: Risk Assessment

#### Step 4: Evaluate Potential Impact
**Objective:** Assess the security risk and potential impact of the detected content.

**AI Analysis:**
- Consider file location sensitivity:
  - System directories (high risk)
  - Application directories (medium risk)
  - User directories (variable risk)
  - Temporary directories (lower risk)
- Analyze execution context:
  - Executable files vs. data files
  - Web-accessible locations
  - Process privileges and capabilities

#### Step 5: Check for Indicators of Compromise
**Objective:** Look for additional signs that may indicate actual malicious activity.

**AI Investigation:**
- Examine surrounding files in the same directory
- Look for patterns indicating:
  - Recent unauthorized modifications
  - Unusual file permissions
  - Suspicious file timestamps
  - Multiple related detections

## Expected AI Output

After completing the investigation, provide a comprehensive analysis report with:

### 1. Detection Summary
Alert Type: file-content-suspicious
Detected Pattern: /dark
File Location: /proc/429630/root/usr/lib/python3.6/site-packages/pgadmin4-web/pgadmin/static/scss/resources/dark
Rule Matched: filename-suspicious (^|/)dark$
Threat Category: [Legitimate Application File | Potential False Positive | Requires Investigation | High Risk]

### 2. Legitimacy Assessment
**For Legitimate Files:**
- Explain why the detection is a false positive
- Document the legitimate purpose of the file/pattern
- Recommend rule tuning to prevent future false positives

**For Suspicious Files:**
- Detail specific indicators of malicious intent
- Explain potential attack vectors or purposes
- Assess the confidence level of the threat assessment

### 3. Recommended Actions for Security Operators

**For False Positives:**
```bash
# Add exception to scanning rules
# Update ruleset configuration to exclude legitimate patterns
# Document in false positive database
```

**For Legitimate Suspicious Patterns:**
```bash
# Verify file integrity with known good checksums
sha256sum /path/to/suspicious/file
# Check file permissions and ownership
ls -la /path/to/suspicious/file
# Review recent file modifications
stat /path/to/suspicious/file
```

**For Confirmed Threats:**
```bash
# Isolate the affected system (coordinate with incident response)
# Preserve evidence before remediation
# Quarantine suspicious files
# Initiate malware analysis procedures
```

### 4. Root Cause Analysis
- Specific file paths and detection patterns involved
- Exact rules that triggered the alerts
- Why these patterns were flagged as suspicious
- Application context and legitimacy assessment

### 5. Prevention Recommendations
- Rule tuning to reduce false positives
- Application whitelisting for legitimate patterns
- Enhanced monitoring for confirmed threat patterns
- Security awareness training for detected attack vectors

## Example Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Legitimate Application File
```yaml
detected: /dark
source: /usr/lib/python3.6/site-packages/pgladmin4-web/pgadmin/static/scss/resources/dark
context:
  matched-rule: (^|/)dark$
  ruleset-id: filename-suspicious
```

**AI Should Recommend:**
"This appears to be a legitimate dark theme resource file for pgAdmin4 web interface. The 'dark' pattern is commonly used for UI theming. Recommend adding exception for pgAdmin4 static resources to prevent future false positives."

### Scenario 2: Suspicious System File
```yaml
detected: /tmp/.dark_payload
source: /tmp/.dark_payload
context:
  matched-rule: (^|/)dark.*$
  ruleset-id: filename-suspicious
```

**AI Should Recommend:**
"Hidden file in /tmp with suspicious naming pattern. Requires immediate investigation for potential malware. Check file contents, creation time, and associated processes before quarantine."

## Success Criteria

Investigation is complete when you can answer:
- [ ] Is the detected content legitimate or malicious?
- [ ] What is the specific threat level and potential impact?
- [ ] What immediate actions should security operators take?
- [ ] Are there related files or systems that need investigation?
- [ ] Should detection rules be tuned to prevent false positives?
